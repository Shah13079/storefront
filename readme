# Storefront Projects

This repository contains storefront projects developed for learning purposes. It includes several Django apps demonstrating different concepts and features. Below is a brief overview of the apps included:

## Apps Overview

### Playground App
This app is designed for simple Django practices and experimentation.

### Store App, Tags App, Core App
These apps are built using the **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** and cover a wide range of topics such as:
- Serializers
- Authentication
- Signals
- Administration management
- Multi-level API development (from simple API views to ViewSets)

The project demonstrates comprehensive API development concepts and provides a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs in Django.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available in the project:

### Base Endpoints
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/` 
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/collections/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/carts/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/`

### Nested Endpoints
#### Product Reviews
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/<product_id>/reviews/`
  
#### Cart Items
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/carts/<cart_id>/items/`

## Notes
- Replace `<product_id>` and `<cart_id>` with the appropriate IDs when accessing nested endpoints.

This project is a great resource for understanding how to structure and implement complex APIs with Django and Django Rest Framework. Happy learning!
